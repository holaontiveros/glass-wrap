# Nenúfar Apps

This repository hosts small browser-based utilities by Nenúfar Regalos
Personalizados. Each utility has its own directory under `site/`, which maps
directly to its public URL path.

`site/shared/` contains the reusable Nenúfar header used by the hub and every
utility. It shows the color logo, centered Apps and Shop navigation, and a
language selector. User-facing content is available in English and Spanish.

## Arrow.js migration

The staged Arrow.js migration and behavior-parity test requirements are
documented in [ARROW_MIGRATION_PLAN.md](./ARROW_MIGRATION_PLAN.md).

## Available utilities

- `site/glass-wrap/` → `/glass-wrap/`: print-accurate SVG templates for
  straight and conical glasses.
- `site/sticker-counter/` → `/sticker-counter/`: a 480 mm vinyl layout
  visualizer and counter for identical circle, square, or PNG stickers.

## Use

Open `site/glass-wrap/index.html` in a modern browser, or serve the `site`
directory with any static web server. Enter the outside top diameter, bottom
diameter, and height in millimeters. Equal diameters produce a straight
rectangular wrap; different diameters produce a developed conical wrap.

Enable the optional 10 mm glue tab when the wrap will be glued rather than
printed on sticker paper. The downloaded SVG includes real millimeter `width`
and `height` attributes for 100% printing.

## Check the calculator

```sh
npm test
```

The tests cover validation, straight and conical geometry, near-equal diameter
handling, the 10 mm tab, and SVG export dimensions.

## GitHub Pages

The site is deployed from `site/` by the GitHub Actions workflow in
`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`. In the repository’s **Settings → Pages**,
select **GitHub Actions** as the publishing source once. Future pushes to
`main` publish the current version automatically.

The intended production domain is `https://apps.nenufar.mx`, with utilities
available as paths below it, for example `https://apps.nenufar.mx/glass-wrap/`.
